{"name":"Hyperspyui","tagline":"Hyperspectral dataanalysis, made easy","body":"### A Graphical interface for HyperSpy\r\n[HyperSpy](http://hyperspy.org) is an open source Python library which provides tools to facilitate the interactive data analysis of multidimensional datasets that can be described as multidimensional arrays of a given signal (e.g. a 2D array of spectra a.k.a spectrum image).\r\n\r\nHyperSpy aims at making it easy and natural to apply analytical procedures that operate on an individual signal to multidimensional arrays, as well as providing easy access to analytical tools that exploit the multidimensionality of the dataset.\r\n\r\nHyperSpyUI streamlines user interaction with the powerful analysis capabilities of HyperSpy, while still retaining the raw power of HyperSpy via it's built in IPython console. As HyperSpyUI is made in Python, the same programming language as HyperSpy, the integration is seamless.\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\nCurrently, the development of HyperSpyUI is focused on implementing a solid back-bone for bridging the gap between HyperSpy and the user interface. This involves making sure that it is as easy as possible to add new features to the UI. The next area of focus will then be to add easy, intuitive access to as many of HyperSpy's features as possible.\r\n\r\nHyperSpy itself is stated to be in a \"perpetual beta\". As such, the UI will never be more stable than the underlying drivetrain, however that should only affect the analysis capabilities. The application itself is based on the mature [Qt](http://qt.io) framework, and should be robust.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
